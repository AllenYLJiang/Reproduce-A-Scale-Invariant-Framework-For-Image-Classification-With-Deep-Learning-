The dataset can be downloaded from https://auburn.uvt.nl/

Scripts for downloading:
downsampling_2048.py
downsampling_256_1024.py
downsampling_512.py

The division of images into scale-invariant parts and scale-variant parts can be based on the paper "Scale variant image pyramids", or simply by using the following script:
